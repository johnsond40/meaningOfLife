                There is no doubt that the meaning of life is a subjective and contested ideal. <br>An infinite number of philosophers, researchers, and everyday people attempted to interpret this ideology, but the truth is the meaning of life is different
                for every person. <br> For me personally, I find meaning in life by impacting others in a positive way and having an appreciation for the opportunities I am given. <br>I believe the way to achieve this purpose lies in treating others with
                respect, a strong dedication to responsibility, and treasuring moments above all else.

                        Treating other people with respect is a cornerstone of living a healthy and meaningful life. Not only does kindness allow and support other people attempting to grow, but it also allows you to develop. When you converse with people and show them respect
                        and kindness, you can form bonds of friendships which can increase your life satisfaction. Along with that, you can also obtain personal gratification that can leave you more mentally balanced. Throughout my life, I have found
                        that I am happier while around others, but others will not want to be around me if I do not treat them with respect. Respect is vitally important for forming relationships and impacting lives positively, both of which contribute
                        to building a meaningful life.

                        I firmly believe that striving for and treasuring positive moments are the ultimate keys to finding meaning in life. About a year ago, I came to the realization that at the end of my life, I will not look back on the grades I received or the money I earned;
                        what I will remember are the experiences I had. When I reminisce on my high school and elementary school years, I always recall my days bowling, working the musicals, or the trips I went on with my friends. I was once told by a
                        close friend that “If you’re ever debating spending money a positive experience, you might as well spend it because in twenty years you won’t remember where that money went. You’ll just remember the memories you made.” These words
                        resonate with me still, and I always try to make the most of the experiences I am given. Treasuring the memories you have allows you to live life to the fullest and impact other people in a positive way so everyone can find true
                        meaning in life.

                        I find responsibility to be an important part of leading a meaningful life. No person is exempt from practicing responsibility at some point, whether it be through work, school, exercise, family, or any other aspect of their life. Responsibility is vital
                        to building character, an appreciation for work, and the free time in life. For me personally, I found responsibility through my academics. I always make sure to put them at the forefront of my effort in order to succeed. This
                        constant toiling through my years of schooling lent me the virtue of responsibility and provided me with a greater regard for the free moments I have in life. However, without exercising responsibility, I would never have the appreciation
                        for them that I do now.

                        For this step, I had the good fortune to interview successful entrepreneurs Brent Cooper and Mike Smith. Brent Cooper is the founder of <a href="https://www.cforward.com/" target="_blank" class="businessLinks">C-Forward Information Technologies</a>                        and also the head of the <a href="http://www.nkychamber.com/" target="_blank" class="businessLinks">Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce</a>, while Mike Smith has founded and run the companies Eighty-Twenty Design and <a href="https://www.headquarters.events/"
                            target="_blank" class="businessLinks">Headquarters Historic Event Center</a>. During both of my interviews with them, they impressed upon me how freeing and fulfilling it felt to run their own companies and provide services to
                        customers and jobs to their employees. I was pleasantly surprised by how appealing that sounded to me. Furthermore, both Brent and Mike provided me with plentiful advice on how to begin running my own business one day. They impressed
                        that it is necessary to begin networking early and planning out ideas. They also both informed me how much time and effort it takes to run my own business and how I need to be prepared for this eventuality.

                        In order to start my own nonprofit organization, I need to focus on both long term and short term goals. In one year, I can have the idea for what I want to support concrete in my mind. My medium term goal is to have a rough business plan by the end of
                        college, once I have taken the necessary classes through my management major to understand one. Finally, my five to ten year goal is to find a property and establish legitimate investors to kickstart the organization.

                        job. I am driven by my urge to give back to the community and support other people attempting to do the same. I am already passionate about entrepreneurship and, thanks to Brent Cooper and Mike Smith, I know that it is possible
                        to do what I love and give back in the process. Furthermore, I hope that my audience, the people I am setting out to help, will find what they need order to somewhat alleviate their situation.

                        For my project plan, I am choosing to utilize the three to five years part of my goals, which is creating a rough business plan. Business plans are not simple things to draft, especially when I am not completely sure what I want my nonprofit to support
                        or how I want it to operate. However, after my one year goal (inventing the idea of what I want my organization to be) is complete, I believe that I can successfully begin work on a proper business plan. In terms of impact, this
                        project would be vital to the success of my goals. Any organization getting off the ground needs a solid business plan in order to attract investors and donors. In order to begin my nonprofit, investors are vital and no one would
                        consider investing if I do not have a business plan in place. Brent Cooper and Mike Smith both impressed upon me the importance of hard work and dedication. A business plan requires both of those, and as I am driven by the urge
                        for this philanthropic organization to succeed it is essential for my dreams to become a reality. In terms of audience, my business plan project would target not only investors and donors, but also the people I am seeking to serve.
                        After my one year goal is complete and I have decided what I want my organization to support, my business plan can become more fully realized because I will know what I am working towards. Ultimately, that demographic will be my
                        audience, as the business plan will be geared towards them in the hopes that my organization can assist in whatever plight they have.
